# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** The three-knob analog engine (morph, character, drift) that lets users dial in anywhere from pristine digital to authentic vintage analog character, with immediate visual feedback.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Plugin Scaffold and Panel

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- LFO-first strategy: LFO validates entire three-knob engine at sub-audio rates before VCO adds audio-rate complexity
- Character before drift: Character defines the sound target; drift destabilizes it
- Used default RACK_DIR ?= ../Rack-SDK to avoid GNU Make space-in-path issues
- Declared complete enum set (5 params, 2 inputs, 2 outputs) upfront so widget positions are fixed for all future phases
- Reused POC letter library for Forge Audio brand consistency across plugins

### Pending Todos
